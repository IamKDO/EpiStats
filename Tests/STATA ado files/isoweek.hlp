{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:isoweek} helps you obtain the week number of a date, according to the ISO 8601 date and time standard.
 Default settings give you four variables calculated from the date: {it:_iso}week, {it:_iso}weekyear, {it:_iso}date
 and {it:_iso}weeklab. Using the {opt gen()} option replaces the {it:_iso} prefix with a user-defined one.

{p 8 8 2}
{bf} {it:_iso}week {sf} gives you the ISO week number for {bf}datevar{sf}.

{p 8 8 2}
{bf} {it:_iso}weekyear {sf} gives you the year associated with the ISO week number. This enables you to construct
a week date if required ({it:_iso}weekyear+{it:_iso}week)

{p 8 8 2}
{bf} {it:_iso}date {sf} gives you the first date of the ISO week. This is useful in graphs.

{p 8 8 2}
{bf} {it:_iso}weeklab {sf} gives you a the week number and year as a string variable.

{title:Options for isoweek}

{dlgtab:Options}

{phang}
{cmd:generate(newvar)}generates a new variable with prefix {it:newvar} and suffix {it:week}, {it:weekyear},
{it:date} and {it:weeklab}; the default is to have prefix {it:_iso}.

{phang}
{opt format(dmy|mdy)}}specifies the format if {bf}datevar{sf} is a string variable. You can use {it:dmy} or {it:mdy} to specify 
the format. {it:dmy} is the default.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt fill} adds extra records if there is a gap in sequential ISO weeks in the dataset, 
similiar to {help tsfill:{it:tsfill}}. Filled records will have missing values apart from the generated time variables.
Only works if the date variable is unique.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt nb} creates an extra variable with suffix {it:weeknb}, giving you a sequential number, representing the ISO week
in your dataset. The {it:weeknb} starts at 1 for the earliest ISO week. This variable is useful for time
 series analysis.{p_end}

{title:Examples}

{phang}{cmd:. isoweek swabdate } {p_end}

{pstd}If using a date variable coded as "mdy", e.g. "06/23/1980"{p_end}
{phang}{cmd:. isoweek birthdate, format(mdy)} {p_end}

{pstd}Collapsing the dataset into counts of the date of interest and filling any gaps in associated weeks{p_end}
{phang}{cmd:. collapse (count) id, by(onsetdate)} {p_end}
{phang}{cmd:. isoweek onsetdate, fill} {p_end}
